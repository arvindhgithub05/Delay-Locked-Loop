# Delay-Locked-Loop
- Implemented a Phase-Frequency Detector, 5-bit counter and a Delay line using static CMOS circuits.
– Achieved accurate timing synchronization by simulating DLL behavior under various process conditions.
– Adding frequency-noise parameters to analyze its effects and impact on the waveforms and determine lock period.
– Plotted Timing Diagrams, Eye Diagrams, Steady State Error waveforms and cross-over points
– Tool Used for Implementation: Cadence Virtuoso
